Feedback:
I found the temperature converter to be relatively straightforward and easy to use. I have tested all three possible options and tried converting different numbers to see how the program would behave. It has successfully converted each number, even when trying edge cases like negative numbers or zero. The README file was helpful in installing it so I had no troubles running the program.
